## Database Setup

If you need help installing your databases, follow these guides (click to expand).

<details>
  <summary><h3>PostgreSQL</h3></summary>
  

  1. Install database engine.
```bash
sudo apt install postgresql
```
```bash
sudo -i -u postgres
psql
CREATE USER yourusername WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
ALTER USER yourusername CREATEDB;
```
```bash

```

2. Start the database service.
```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

### Other Issues


Running MySQL on local machine: Must allow external connections.
```sql
-- Allow root from all IPs (not secure):
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_root_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

DB_NAME in .env must be all lowercase for Postgres.


### Neo4j Installation for WSL (Ubuntu)

1. Install prerequisites `wget`, `gnupg`, and `apt-transport-https`

Without these, you can’t fetch and trust Neo4j’s signing key or add an HTTPS repo.

```bash
sudo apt install -y wget gnupg apt-transport-https
```

2. Add the GPG key

Apt refuses to install packages from unknown sources. The GPG key tells apt to trust packages signed by Neo4j.

```bash
wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/neo4j-archive-keyring.gpg
```

3. Add the Neo4j repository

By default, Ubuntu only knows about Canonical’s repos. Adding the Neo4j repo is like specifying which warehouse has the Neo4j software. Without it, apt won’t find the `neo4j` package.

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/neo4j-archive-keyring.gpg] https://debian.neo4j.com stable 5" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
```

4. Run `apt update` after adding the repo

This refreshes apt’s index. Until you do, apt has no idea that Neo4j packages exist.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

5. Install Neo4j

Now apt knows where to find the package and can verify its signature.

```bash
sudo apt install -y neo4j
```

### First-time setup

1. Start the database service. Ignore the message that Neo4j is running on port 7474 instead of 7687 - it runs on both.

```bash
sudo service neo4j start
```

2. Log in with default username and password. `cypher-shell` is installed with `neo4j`.

```bash
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p neo4j
```

3. Prompted to change password on first login (8+ chars long). Use `:exit` to return to WSL terminal.

4. Verify number of nodes and edges generated by src.main:

```cql
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN count(r);
```

#### If you are also running the web application:

5. Allow external connections to database (e.g. web app)

```bash
sudo nano /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
```
Uncomment line `server.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0`


6. Find local IP (inet) of your WSL shell. Dynamic IP so may change on restart.

```bash
ip addr show eth0
```

7. Test connection from Windows PowerShell. Successful if screen goes blank.

```bash
telnet <ip> 7687
```

8. To allow HTTP requests from WSL to reach Blazor app, find local IP from PowerShell with `ipconfig`, and test the connection from WSL using `curl http://<local_ip>:5055/metrics`. In Blazor, listening for all IPs is generally unsafe, so Windows Firewall may try to block it. Allowing only on Private networks is fine. If you press Cancel accidentally and need to reverse it, open Windows Firewall -> Inbound Rules, and allow BlazorApp.


### Hostname Resolution

For a comprehensive guide on how to configure your `.env` values to work across Docker containers, please use our Hostname Reference Table in the [Docker Guide](docs/docker_setup.md).


### Makefile Commands

#### db-start-local
Start only the `localhost` databases specified in `.env`
```bash
make db-start-local
```


## Network Security

### Overview

Since this project contains components running on different systems, we generally allow databases to listen for ANY incoming connection to their port (all network interfaces _i.e._ 0.0.0.0). As seen above, Neo4j on WSL must listen on 0.0.0.0 to accept queries from our Blazor app running on Windows.

This problem will spread as we scale in future versions; a remote Blazor server could run on a different machine & different network, and still want access to our local Neo4j installation.

### Risks

- Modern private Wi-Fi routers use NAT by default: all incoming connections from external hosts will be rejected, unless we explicitly port-forward. Public networks (e.g. McDonalds free wifi) may not do this.

- If an attacker knows your public IP address, your computer may be exposed on your network, allowing free access to send commands through any open ports.

- Windows firewall will block external connections but only for services running on Windows. WSL and Docker containers do not have this same level of protection.

- Database credentials may feel inconsequential, but short or common passwords are very easy to brute-force.

- When an attacker gains access to a service running on your machine with elevated permissions, there are usually ways to compromise the host system - stealing sensitive data from Windows, installing external malware, or deleting your files.

### Our Unsafe Practices

- Some native WSL databases are configured to listen on 0.0.0.0 (Neo4j).

- Some docker containers will not function unless configured to listen on 0.0.0.0 (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MongoDB).

- When running databases with Docker Compose, databases sometimes block superuser permissions if their connection is external, even if their credentials are correct. Our Makefile elevates `root@'%'` (the remote root user) to address this.

### Precautions & Mitigation

1. Use unique, long, random passwords and avoid default usernames.

2. Run the main pipeline from a secure, private network - so home, school, or work.

3. Do not leave database services running on the background when unused, and consider rotating credentials.

4. Avoid everyday use of superuser accounts (`root`, `postgres`, `neo4j`), even if your existing database installation is configured this way. Create a dedicated user for the app and grant only the permissions it needs.

5. Optionally check `docker-compose.yml` and `Makefile` for `0.0.0.0` and remove them. It may still work depending on your configuration.

6. Instead of allowing full access to out-of-network machines, use a VPN to connect with the secured network remotely.
