Generated summary:
Cyril recites a traditional account of the Phoenix: eagle-sized with a golden crest and neck, purple body, white tail, star-like eyes, living about 500 years, then burning itself on a fragrant pyre so a worm rises from its ashes to become the new bird. The Phoenix interrupts, calling this wrong: its body isn’t purple, its tail isn’t white, and there’s no worm; instead, it builds the pyre, lays an egg, burns itself, awakens inside the egg, hatches, and repeats the cycle—though it’s tired of the endless repetition. Anthea then asks how the Phoenix’s egg came to be here.
