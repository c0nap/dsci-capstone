Their first adventure on the carpet was to a bazaar in India, though it wasn't quite the romantic experience they had imagined. The Phoenix had assured them it would be perfectly safe, but the moment they arrived in the crowded marketplace, they realized they were attracting rather too much attention. The Phoenix, perched on Robert's shoulder, was causing quite a stir among the local merchants. "That's a remarkable bird you have there, young sahib," said one merchant, eyeing the Phoenix with undisguised interest. "I'll give you fifty rupees for it." "He's not for sale," Robert said quickly, though he wasn't entirely sure what a rupee was worth. The Phoenix huffed indignantly. "As if I could be bought and sold like a common parrot! The very idea!" This outburst, naturally, only increased the merchant's interest. Soon they were surrounded by curious onlookers, all wanting to see the talking bird. Cyril grabbed the carpet, which they'd folded up and brought with them, and shouted, "I wish we were back home!" In an instant, the marketplace vanished and they found themselves tumbling onto the nursery floor. The Phoenix landed gracefully on the mantelpiece and began preening its feathers. "Well," it said, "that could have gone better. Perhaps next time we should discuss the finer points of discretion before embarking on our travels. A Phoenix of my distinction really shouldn't have to endure being mistaken for common poultry." Despite the chaotic ending, the children were thrilled. They had traveled to India and back in the span of minutes! What other wonders might the carpet show them? Mother called up the stairs that dinner was ready, and they reluctantly agreed to continue their adventures another day. As they filed out of the nursery, the Phoenix settled down on the carpet with a contented sigh. "Children," it murmured to itself. "So wonderfully impulsive. This is going to be an interesting arrangement indeed."
