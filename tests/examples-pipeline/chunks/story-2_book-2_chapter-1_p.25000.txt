The children had been looking forward to their new carpet. When it finally arrived, rolled up in brown paper and tied with string, they could hardly contain their excitement. Mother said they mustn't unroll it until Father came home, but of course they did anyway. As they spread it out on the nursery floor, they noticed something peculiar - there was a large egg nestled in the middle of the carpet's pattern. "What an odd decoration," said Cyril, poking it gently. But it wasn't a decoration at all. The egg was warm to the touch, and as they watched in amazement, it began to crack. A golden light spilled out from the fissures, growing brighter and brighter until they had to shield their eyes. When the light faded, there stood the most magnificent bird they had ever seen - a Phoenix, with feathers that shimmered like flames and eyes that sparkled with ancient wisdom. "Good morning," said the Phoenix politely. "I do apologize for the dramatic entrance. I've been waiting rather a long time for someone to find me." The children were speechless. Robert finally managed to stammer, "You can talk?" The Phoenix looked somewhat offended. "Of course I can talk. I'm a Phoenix. We're remarkably well-educated birds, I'll have you know. We've had thousands of years to learn things." It ruffled its magnificent feathers and continued, "Now then, about this carpet. It's not just any carpet, you see. It's a wishing carpet, capable of taking you anywhere in the world - or indeed, to any time. Though I must warn you, the wishes don't always work out quite as you'd expect." Anthea, always the practical one, asked, "Does that mean we can go on adventures?" The Phoenix nodded sagely. "Oh yes, adventures aplenty. Though I'd recommend starting with somewhere relatively safe. Perhaps ancient Egypt? I have fond memories of Egypt." Jane clapped her hands together. "Oh, could we really? That would be absolutely wonderful!" The carpet beneath their feet gave a slight tremor, as if in agreement.
