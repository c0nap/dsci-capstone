‘No doubt,’ said the bird, politely.
‘And the carpet hasn’t moved an inch,’ said Robert.
‘No,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I see it hasn’t.’
‘But I thought it was a wishing carpet?’
‘So it is,’ said the Phoenix.
‘Then why—?’ asked the children, altogether.
‘I did tell you, you know,’ said the Phoenix, ‘only you are so fond of listening to the music of your own voices. It is, indeed, the most lovely music to each of us, and therefore—’
‘You did tell us WHAT?’ interrupted an Exasperated.
‘Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU’VE HAD THEM.’
There was a heartfelt silence.
‘Then how are we going to get home?’ said Cyril, at last.
‘I haven’t any idea,’ replied the Phoenix, kindly. ‘Can I fly out and get you any little thing?’
‘How could you carry the money to pay for it?’
‘It isn’t necessary. Birds always take what they want. It is not regarded as stealing, except in the case of magpies.’
The children were glad to find they had been right in supposing this to be the case, on the day when they had wings, and had enjoyed somebody else’s ripe plums.
‘Yes; let the Phoenix get us something to eat, anyway,’ Robert urged—’ (‘If it will be so kind you mean,’ corrected Anthea, in a whisper); ‘if it will be so kind, and we can be thinking while it’s gone.’

And here is the original text:
‘No,’ said the Phoenix, looking about it at the high dark walls of the tower. ‘No; I quite see that.’
‘But we wished to be at home,’ said Cyril.
‘No doubt,’ said the bird, politely.
‘And the carpet hasn’t moved an inch,’ said Robert.
‘No,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I see it hasn’t.’

Generated summary:
Anthea and her siblings, Jane and Cyril, along with their friend Robert, spar with a magical Phoenix who possesses a carpet and treats it as a sacred object. They wrestle with domestic concerns—Anthea asks Phoenix for permission to tell their mother about the missing Cook, while she and others care for their ill mother, washing and warming her and managing household duties. The Phoenix performs theatrically, claiming the carpet as its temple, tossing out grand pronouncements, and urging ritualized displays; it also references French and ceremony as part of its self-important persona. Robert alternates between mischief and loyalty, threatening and chasing Jane, slipping through a trapdoor, and ultimately earning the undying respect of everyone after a tense sequence. The episode blends ordinary chores, magical interference, and perilous adventure—embedding Noah’s Ark play, a cab ride to fetch the carpet, and the group’s evolving bond as they navigate the Phoenix’s antics.
